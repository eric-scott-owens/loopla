<h2 id="anchors-github">Github Basics</h2>

Each user has a complete self-contained version of the code repository. Each user can create multiple "branches" or versions of the code within their repository. Their main version is called the master. Each user is responsible for updating their version(s) (using the 'git pull' command) to pull in changes made by others. Users then broadcast their own changes using the 'git push' command.

Visit [Loopla's Brand and Release Strategy](https://github.com/Loopla-1/Django-prototype-1/blob/master/Documents/Branch-and-Release-Strategy.md) to learn how we deploy code on Git.

Files can be in one of two states: 
* tracked - Under Git version control
* untracked - Ignored by Git

Tracked files can then been in one of three states:
* modified - your version of the file has been changed
* staged - your changed version is ready to be committed
* committed - file is up-to-date in the repository

<h2 id="anchors-python-django">Python & Django</h2>

* Python is a general purpose interpreted programming language
* Django is web framework built on top of Python
* As of November 2, 2017 we use Python 3.6.1 and Django 1.11

#### Python Resources

[The Python Website](https://docs.python.org/3/)

[Django video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkwZ1jG3XgA)  
Well regarded but not for absolute beginners

[Python Crash Course - Book](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based/dp/1593276036)       
Ask Anne or Henry to borrow a copy  
Well written book. Not comprehensive. Covers basic features of Python but not many of the advanced ones. Has a really excellent chapter for getting started with Django. By far the best tutorial I've encountered on Django. Much better than the ones on the djangoproject.com

[Learning Python - Book](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-5th-Mark-Lutz/dp/1449355730/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1534098199&sr=8-9&keywords=learn+python+book)  
1500+ page comprehensive tome on Python. It's fairly well written but I often prefer the explanations I find on the Internet

<h2 id="anchors-django-forms">Django Forms</h2>

[Django Forms Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/forms/)

#### Important Files:

**posts/models.py**  
Python file containing the declarations of basic data types such as "post", "comment", etc.

**posts/forms.py**  
Python file specifying how any of the data types can be rendered in a html form. For example, "PostForm" specifies how a 'post' is rendered including the labels in the form, e.g., "Post to circle" is the label for the "group" field and the widget, e.g., 'text', the body of the post, is rendered with 80 columns.

**posts/templates/posts/category.html**  
The Django template for the dashboard. It consists of html with django code. I broke each form into individual fields. Each of these fields can be formatted separately. I think any formatting will override the 'widgets' specification in the forms.py. If not, the widgets specification in forms.py will need to be removed.
